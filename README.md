# Object_Detection_GB_Roads
Development of an object detection model for identifying various road conditions and turns in images captured on roads in Gilgit. The primary goal is to enable the model to detect right turns, left turns, straight roads, and unexpected road conditions such as landslides. For this project I will perfom tasks like: data gathering, data labeling, and the implementation of object detection models, specifically YOLO (You Only Look Once).
# Resources and Tools
• Python programming language
• Roboflow for annotation.
• YOLOv8 for object detection.
• Data collection resources (captured by me).

# Project Objectives
1. Gather a dataset of road images in Gilgit, with a minimum requirement of 50
images per group, captured by the students themselves.
2. Annotate and label the collected data with information about road conditions
and turns.
3. Train a classifier to categorize images into predefined classes: right turn, left
turn, straight, and unexpected.
4. Implement the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection model to
precisely locate and classify turns and unexpected road conditions in images.
5. Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it as needed.
6. Document the entire process, including data collection, labeling, model
training, and evaluation.
